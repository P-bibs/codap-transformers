:: Case Selection ::

generic transformation is [inputs] => [outputs] for n inputs and m outputs.

Idea:
  [1] on selection update, translate into selection of cases in 
    lowest level of hierarchy (at item level effectively)
  [2] map these selections onto lowest level selections in the output
  [3] propagate these mapped selections back up the hierarchy, if possible.

in_1, in_2     ==> forwardMap  ==>      out_1, out_2, out_3
               <== backwardMap <==

Maps are: (context: string, id: number) => (context: string, ids: number[])[]

Listening / propagating updates:

  On each input table, setup a selection listener:
    (cases) => {
      cases = translateToLowestLevel(inContext, cases)
      updatedSelections = {}

      for each case of cases {
        translated = forwardMap[inContext, case.id]

        for each (outContext, ids) in translated {
          updatedSelections[outContext].add(ids)
        }
      }

      for (outContext, ids) in updatedSelections {
        TODO: selection = translateToHigherLevels(outContext, ids)
        createSelectionList(outContext, selection)
      }
    }

  On each output table, same except replace forwardMap with backwardMap


:: How to encode IDs? ::

Need:
 - lookup ID to get all child IDs (high to low translation)
 - TODO: have access to list of all IDs at a given level (low to high)

- can modify getDataFromContext to return a data structure that encapsulates
  this information about ID structure


:: How do transformations get ID info to construct the maps? ::

  - it would make most sense to have the IDs attached to records in the datasets?
    - transformations only need to map between record IDs anyway (cases 
      at the lowest level)
    - can modify getDataFromContext to include this ID info

:: Keep tables from infinitely propagating selection updates to each other :: 

- query for the selection list of the table you're about to update--if
  it is the same as what you're going to send, abort the update


:: Bugs ::

- selection updates break editing cells somehow?
- selection updates don't chain? listener isn't being called for 
  programmatic updates of selection list?
- after updates, maps are broken (IDs change)
